# Bidirectional Streaming Programming Guide

A comprehensive guide of bidirectional streaming programing with ADK.

## Requirements for writing the guide

- Make it a readable document, like a popular programming guide book
- Use mkdoc format. Refer to `custom-streaming.md` as a sample of the format.
- Use various types of Mermaid diagrams for introducing new concepts and capabilities
- For sample code, create a directory under `src` for each chapter, and write sample code files with intuitive file names that start with the chapter and section numbers (e.g. `1-1-1_hello_world.py`)
- Add HTML links when referring to external resources
- Avoid inserting long sample code in the text. Instead, insert snippet of the most important parts with a few lines each, with explanation.
